# Network Traffic Anomaly Analysis

**Author:** Reshan Dulal  

## Problem Statement
Modern networks generate massive volumes of traffic, making it difficult 
to detect anomalous behavior such as attacks or unusual usage patterns.
This project analyzes network traffic data to identify potential anomalies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains network traffic records with features such as:
- packet size
- protocol type
- source and destination information
- traffic volume

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- SQL
- Data visualization (matplotlib / seaborn)

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Statistical analysis
4. Anomaly detection
5. Visualization of findings

## Expected Outcome
Identify abnormal traffic patterns and summarize insights that can help 
network administrators improve security and monitoring.
